**ELIXIR Norway contributes to the following EU projects through ELIXIR Norway**
<br/>
 
[ELIXIR-CONVERGE](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge)

is a project funded by the European Commission to help standardise life science data management across Europe. To achieve this standardisation, the project will develop a data management toolkit for life scientists. The toolkit will help ensure more research data is in the public domain, which will give scientists access to more data. This will allow them to discover new insights into the challenges facing society, such as food security and health in old age, and help stimulate innovation in biomedicine and biotechnology.

ELIXIR Norway is involved in all work packages of CONVERGE. We co-lead WP3 on Common Data Management Toolkit and Demonstrator 3 in WP5, on Common Data management plans for the marine metagenomics Community. ELIXIR Norway's activities in ELIXIR-CONVERGE are well coordinated with the national BioMedData project.

[Beyond 1 Million Genomes](https://b1mg-project.eu/)

This project is helping to create a network of genetic and clinical data across Europe. The project provides coordination and support to the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative (1+MG). This initiative is a commitment of 23 European countries to give cross-border access to one million sequenced genomes by 2022.

[EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/)
EOSC-Life brings together the 13 Life Science ‘ESFRI’ research infrastructures to create an open, digital and collaborative space for biological and medical research. These infrastructures will publish data from facilities and data resources in the EOSC and link these resources to open and reusable Tools and Workflows accessible to users via Europe’s national and international life-science clouds. ELIXIR Norway is involved in the amended WP14 'COVID-19 Data Trials' of EOSC-Life, to carry out the design, development, implementation and use of a repository for individual participant data from COVID-19 trials. The UiO Services for sensitive data, TSD, is currently being set up as the secure environment for this repository and the beta version will be launched in February 2021.
