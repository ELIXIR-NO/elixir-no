title: Nordic collaboration on sensitive data

---

ELIXIR Norway collaborates with the other Nordic ELIXIR Nodes (Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Estonia) in developing and facilitating access to secure e-infrastructure for sensitive data, suitable for hosting large-scale cross-border biomedical research studies. The work is funded as a series of project by [NeIC, the Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration](https://neic.no/). The project is now entering its third phase with the onset of the Heilsa Tryggvedottir project, which builds on the accomplishments of the preceding [Tryggve and Tryggve2 projects](https://neic.no/tryggve/).

Tryggve develops state-of-the-art scalable infrastructure for safe, efficient, ethical, and legal storage, analysis and sharing of sensitive personal data for biomedical research between countries. The project supports open and transparent data access processes by engaging with the key stakeholders from each of the Nordic countries. The outcomes of NeIC Tryggve projects will enable researchers to conduct their research utilising sensitive data in secure settings and facilitate Nordic collaboration in biomedical research

The FEGA Norway production services was one of the first to be connected to Central EGA, European Genome-Phenome Archive, production services and they are now able to receive datasets from submitters that automatically will get live production EGA accession numbers for Study, Datasets and Files, and be Findable and discoverable in the Central EGA web portal. In February 2024, another great milestone was reached for the FEGA Norway: the first datasets are now available in the Federated European Genome-phenome Archive (FEGA). These datasets are discoverable in the EGA portal (https://ega-archive.org/) and accessible according to national laws.
