title: Life-Science RDM Group
---

**Background**
The Life-Science RDM Group, initiated by the BioMedData research infrastructure project in 2022, brings together RDM experts in the life sciences across Norway. This group meets monthly with presentations of two different scopes: one from an organisation providing an overview of its practices in data management and the other from an invited speaker concerning a topic of general interest.

<br />
<br />

**Aim**

This activity aims to establish a group of life science RDM experts in Norway and enable an informal and inclusive exchange of knowledge and experiences, thus promoting the spread of competencies and the adoption of good practices.
