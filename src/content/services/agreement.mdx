title: Agreement

For requests that require platform contribution for more than two days, an agreement between the client and the platform must be made. The agreement should cover type and cost of the service. If applicable, the agreement should also cover a plan for publication and co-authorship.

Regardless of the type of contribution the platform has given to a project, we expect to be acknowledged in resulting publications.
