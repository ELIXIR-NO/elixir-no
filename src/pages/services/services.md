The BioXSD/GTrack ecosystem is a family of interoperable data formats and supportive tools for biomolecular sequences, features, alignments, references.


# FAIRtracks
FAIRtracks is an ecosystem for gathering, curating, validating, integrating, and indexing the metadata of genomic track datasets


# SalmoBase
SalmoBase is a comprehensive data resource for Atlantic salmon and other salmonid genome information.


# Licebase
LiceBase is a model organism database collecting genomic information and annotation of the Atlantic salmon louse, a major fish parasite with an impact on global ecology and aquaculture economy.


# The Marine Metagenomics Portal
The Marine Metagenomics Portal provides access to high-quality curated and freely accessible marine microbial genomics and metagenomics resources. It includes the MAR databases, a collection of richly annotated and manually curated contextual and sequence databases, and MetaPipe, a complete workflow for the analysis of marine metagenomic data.

 

# CarveME
CarveMe is a software tool for automated generation of genome-scale metabolic models

 

# CHOPCHOP
CHOPCHOP is a web tool for identifying CRISPR–Cas single guide RNA (sgRNA) targets

 

# immuneML
immuneML is a machine learning framework to predict adaptive immune response and disease, as initially described in Pavlovic et al.

 

# NFEGA
NFEGA, the Norwegian Federated Node of EGA, the European Genome-Phenome Archive, a repository for personally identifiable genetic and phenotypic data from biomedical research projects.

 

# Covid-19 Data Portal Norway
Covid-19 Data Portal Norway is a portal to Norwegian research efforts against Covid-19, with guidelines, tools, databases and services to support Norwegian COVID-19 researchers.

 

# SARS-CoV2 DB
SARS-CoV2 DB is a database with high-quality curated and freely accessible SARS-CoV-2 genomics- and contextual resources.

 

# JASPAR
JASPAR is an open access database of manually curated, non-redundant transcription factor (TF) binding profiles

 

# MirGeneDB
MirGeneDB is a database of manually curated microRNA genes that have been validated and annotated as initially described in Fromm et al. 2015. MirGeneDB 2.1 includes more than 16,000 microRNA gene entries representing more than 1,500 miRNA families from 74 metazoan species. All microRNAs can be browsed, searched and downloaded.

 

# UniBind
UniBind is a portal to access a database storing collections of direct interactions between transcription factors and DNA (a.k.a. transcription factor binding sites) in nine species.

 
# WEBnma
WEBnma is a tool to predict flexibility in protein structures.

 

# RDMkit
The RDMkit is a resouce initiated by ELIXIR Converge under involvement of ELIXIR Norway. It empowers researchers struggling to manage their research data by offering dedicated guidance on the research data life cycle
 stages, the user’s role, the research domain, the data management problem, the tools and resources needed and includes practical examples for tools assemblies.

 

# BioMedData
BioMedData is a research infrastructure to promote FAIR data management within the life sciences. The project was established in 2020 as a collaboration between 11 Norwegian life-science infrastructures. BioMedData is funded by the Research Council of Norway and will run until 2024.


# Data Stewardship Wizard
The Data Stewardship Wizard is an international project to help serious researchers and data stewards with building smart Data Management Plans (DMPs) for FAIR Open Science. We offer a dedicated instance for life scientists in Norway with tailored guidance.


# Data sharing
In NeLS researchers can safely store and share scientific data, also with collaborators residing outside of Norway. In addition, data analysis performed in usegalaxy.no together with the results from the analysis can easily be shared with collaborators.


# Data storage
ELIXIR Norway offers an infrastructure for storage of scientific data, intended for scientific research projects with larger sets of data (minimum 1TB) for mid-term storage. We currently offer free storage of data up to 10TB. For larger projects, please contact us at contact@bioinfo.no.

All research projects with a Norwegian partner with funding from national funding bodies (NFR, Universities, Helseforetak, etc) and EU grants are entitled to store life science data in NeLS. This also includes private companies and governmental research institutions.

Research projects (with a Norwegian partner) that do not fall into the definition above can still apply for a storage quota, but these projects will be treated according to the user contribution model for granting storage to projects by Sigma2.

If you data is generated at one of the Norwegian sequencing core facilities organized in NorSeq, your core facility can help you with the application and directly upload the data to NeLS for you.

The storage quota provided are available in the NeLS infrastructure for non-sensitive data and in TSD for sensitive data. This service is operated in collaboration with Sigma2, through the national storage infrastructure NIRD.


# EDAM
EDAM, provided in tight collaboration with ELIXIR France is a comprehensive ontology of well-established, familiar concepts that are prevalent within bioinformatics and computational biology, including types of data and data identifiers, data formats, operations and topics. EDAM provides a set of concepts with preferred terms and synonyms, definitions, and some additional information - organised into a simple and intuitive hierarchy for convenient use.

 

# Interoperability
Interoperability is one of the four FAIR principles and means the ability of systems and tools to exchange and make use of information and thereby work together. ELIXIR Norway staff is strongly involved in the activities of the ELIXIR Interoperability Platform, which develops and encourages the adoption of standards to describe life science data.
