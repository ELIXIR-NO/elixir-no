TSD is provided by the University of Oslo Centre for Information Technology ([USIT](https://www.usit.uio.no)), and has a long-standing collaboration with ELIXIR Norway and serves as a foundation when it comes to managing sensitive data. 

ELIXIR Norway can provide [storage quotas](#data-storage) on TSD.
