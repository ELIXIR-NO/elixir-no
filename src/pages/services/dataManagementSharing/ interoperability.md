### Interoperability
Interoperability is one of the four [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles) and means the ability of systems and tools to exchange and make use of information and thereby work together. ELIXIR Norway staff is strongly involved in the activities of the ELIXIR Interoperability Platform, which develops and encourages the adoption of standards to describe life science data.
