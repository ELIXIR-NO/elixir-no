### RDMkit
The [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org) is a resource initiated by [ELIXIR Converge](https://elixir.no/news/20/103/ELIXIR-CONVERGE-a-new-project-to-streamline-data-management-practices) under involvement of ELIXIR Norway. It empowers researchers struggling to manage their research data by offering dedicated guidance on the research data life cycle stages, the user's role, the research domain, the data management problem, the tools and resources needed and includes practical examples for tools assemblies.
