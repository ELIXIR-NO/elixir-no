### Data Stewardship Wizard

The [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://elixir-no.ds-wizard.org) is an international project to help serious researchers and data stewards with building smart Data Management Plans (DMPs) for [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles) Open Science. We offer a dedicated instance for life scientists in Norway with tailored guidance.
