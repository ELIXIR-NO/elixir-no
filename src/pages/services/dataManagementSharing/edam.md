### EDAM
[EDAM](http://edamontology.org), provided in tight collaboration with ELIXIR France is a comprehensive ontology of well-established, familiar concepts that are prevalent within bioinformatics and computational biology, including types of data and data identifiers, data formats, operations and topics. EDAM provides a set of concepts with preferred terms and synonyms, definitions, and some additional information - organised into a simple and intuitive hierarchy for convenient use.
