# MirGeneDB
MirGeneDB is a database of manually curated microRNA genes that have been validated and annotated as initially described in Fromm et al. 2015. MirGeneDB 2.1 includes more than 16,000 microRNA gene entries representing more than 1,500 miRNA families from 74 metazoan species. All microRNAs can be browsed, searched and downloaded.
