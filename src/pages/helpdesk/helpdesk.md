# HELPDESK

## IMPORTANT NOTE!
Our request tracker service through [contact@bioinfo.no](contact@bioinfo.no) is unfortunately out of order. While we are working hard to fix this issue, kindly contact our Helpdesk heads [David Dolan](mailto:David.Dolan@uib.no) and [Dorota Buczek](mailto:dorota.j.buczek@uit.no) directly if you are in need of support.

We are very sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience!

#### Contact us by email at ~~contact@bioinfo.no~~

The request then goes out to all members of the Helpdesk and is picked up by the one with the most expertise on the particular topic.

## Usage instructions
ELIXIR Norway also hosts a documentation for the use of our infrastructure. The documentation can be found [here](https://nels-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Storage request
To apply for a storage quota, download and fill in a storage request form (spreadsheet) from [here](https://github.com/elixir-no-nels/nels-docs/blob/main/docs/files/ELIXIR_Norway_StorageRequestForm_rev2021.xlsx) _(this will be replaced soon)_

## Support model
Projects that can be solved within two working days or less are free of charge (enabled by funding from the Research Council of Norway). For more comprehensive projects, an hourly rate applies, and you need to enter an [agreement](https://elixir.no/helpdesk/agreement) with ELIXIR Norway on this.


Projects that require an effort beyond technical assistance/consultancy may be set up as a research collaboration, e.g. by providing funding for a percentage of the position of a helpdesk member.
